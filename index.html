<h2>What is AI?</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Artificial intelligence(AI) is the behavior and specific characteristics of computer
 programs that make them mimic human mentalcapabilities and working patterns. Among the most important of these 
characteristics is the ability to learn, infer, and react to situations not programmed in the machine. 
And artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. Artificial intelligence is defined by many works as
 "the study and design of smart clients", and a smart customer is a system that absorbs its environment and takes 
situations that increase its chance of success in achieving its mission or the mission of its team.

<p style="font-size:20px">Artificial intelligence also refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that
 exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the 
best chance of achieving a specific goal.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px">There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence.
 The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess 
problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position 
so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing
 of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. 
More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations.
 For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word
 such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule
 and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbs.</p>
